# LINUX
Unix is a computer Operating System which is capable of handling activities from multiple users at the same time.
The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.
A user can also run multiple programs at the same time; hence Unix is a multitasking environment.
kernal:-The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.
Kernel − The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.
Shell − The shell is the utility that processes your requests. When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands. C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell are the most famous shells which are available with most of the Unix variants.
